            <p> <b>What is modern slavery ? </b> Modern slavery is the severe exploitation of other people for 
            personal or commercial gain. Modern slavery is all around us, but often just out of sight. People can 
            become entrapped making our clothes, serving our food, picking our crops, working in factories, or 
            working in houses as cooks, cleaners or nannies. From the outside, it can look like a normal job. But 
            people are being <b> controlled </b> – they can face violence or threats, be forced into inescapable debt, or 
            have had their passport taken away and are being threatened with deportation. Many have fallen into 
            this oppressive trap simply because they were trying to escape poverty or insecurity, improve their 
            lives and support their families. <b> Now, they can’t leave.</b> </p>

            <p> <b> What is Human Trafficking? </b> Human trafficking involves the use of force, fraud, or coercion to 
            obtain some type of labor or commercial sex act. Every year, <b> millions of men, women, and children are 
            trafficked worldwide </b> – including right here in the United States. It can happen in any community and victims 
            can be any age, race, gender, or nationality. Traffickers might use violence, manipulation, or false promises
             of well-paying jobs or romantic relationships to lure victims into trafficking situations. </p>

             <p> <b> What does Trafficking mean? </b> What trafficking really means is girls groomed and forced into sexual 
             exploitation; men tricked into accepting risky job offers and trapped in forced labour in building sites, farms or 
             factories; and women recruited to work in private homes only to be trapped, exploited and abused behind closed 
             doors with no way out. </p>

             <p> <b> How do people become entangled in Human Trafficking? </b> People trapped by traffickers are mostly trying 
             to escape poverty or discrimination, improve their lives and support their families. Vulnerable people are often 
             forced to take unimaginable risks to try and escape poverty or persecution, accepting precarious job offers and 
             making hazardous migration decisions, often borrowing money from their traffickers in advance. </p>

            <h1> Solutions: </h1>

            <h4> Disclamer-Modern Slavery is a complex issue with complicated root causes such as discrimination, 
                 all sorts of vulnerabilities such as poverty, lack of education, lack of economic opportunities, 
                 migration status, the lack of rule of law and many others. As such, most if not all of the solutions 
                 below are only possible in a best case scenario. </h4>

                 <br>

            <ul>
                <li> By learning the signs that someone is being trafficked, prevention becomes a viable solution to the problem. </li>
                <li> By arresting those who contribute to Human Trafficking it will be possible to not only prevent people from being trafficked but also stop new victims </li>
                <li> Having those in power make stricter laws that make it more difficult to traffick victims. i.e. A law that looks into whether or not undocumented people are being trafficked.
            </ul>
