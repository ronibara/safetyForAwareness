    <p> <b>What is poverty ? </b> Poverty is a state or condition in which a person or community lacks the financial resources and essentials for a minimum standard of living. <b>What is multidimensional poverty?</b>
Multidimensional poverty acknowledges that poverty isn’t always about income.Although poverty is often discussed in terms of dollar amounts, quality of life is also part of the conversation. Living in poverty means a life of struggle and deprivation. Children living in poverty often lack access to a quality education. Sometimes it’s because there’s not enough quality schools, their parents cannot afford school fees, or because impoverished families need their children to work. Without a quality education, children grow up being unable to provide for their own children — thus the generational cycle of poverty. <b>What is absolute poverty and relative poverty? </b>Absolute poverty is when a person cannot afford the minimum nutrition, clothing, or shelter needs in their country.

Relative poverty is a household income below <b>a certain percentage, typically 50% or 60%, of the median income of that country. </b> This measurement takes into consideration the subjective cost of participating in everyday life. </p>
